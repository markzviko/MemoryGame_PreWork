## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete: 

* [Y] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [Y] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [Y] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [Y] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [Y] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [Y] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [Y] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [N] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [N] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [N] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [N] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [N] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [N] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [N] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [N] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [N] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [Y] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
I can add more visuals and styling to improve the layout of the game for example adding a nice background image and possibly more buttons with images of musicians and add an instrumental instead of just a tone.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used StackOverflow and google

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The only challenge I had was playing the sound or tone, and I checked possible reasons it might not be playing after I reviewed my code and did not see any errors. So I opened my browser consol and viewed my source code and found the line of code that had an error and I googled that error and realized that it was not quite an error but it just does not run on certain browsers. I then took my code to different browsers and it ran well and finally I could hear the sound.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I do not necessarily have any questions, I think this assignment really is really mind opening on the basic fundamentals of Web Development. The fact that it takes everything step by step makes it really easy to think about the code you are writing. 
The main thing that was new to me was putting sound because I have never triied putting sound to any code but it was really exciting seeing how there could be different tones used.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had more time working on this project I would have therefore added a lot other different functionalities to this code such as having background pictures, more buttons with very different features. Initially I tried to put an Image to one of the colored buttons that plays the tone and realized that it would defeat the point of having the button a certain color and I tried adding an extra button. After putting up a new button I realized that the current code was not specifc for it so I would have to write a lot of other code to the CSS and JS to do things to button and that would take a lot of time. 
I would also want to create a greater version of this game where I would put short clips of instrumental music from any artist and add buttoned pictures which would play the artists instrumental when clicked. I would play around a lot with the CSS to change the shapes and layout of the page to suit what I find fancy.
